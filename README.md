# EDA-using-Haberman-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.
In this repo, we are taking Haberman-Dataset to apply EDA in python.
